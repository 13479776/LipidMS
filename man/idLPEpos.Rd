\usage{
idLPEpos(MS1, MSMS1, MSMS2 = data.frame(), ppm_precursor = 5,
  ppm_products = 10, rttol = 3, rt = c(min(MS1$RT), max(MS1$RT)),
  adducts = c("M+H", "M+Na"), clfrags = c(141.01909), clrequired = c(F),
  ftype = c("NL"), chainfrags_sn1 = c("mg_M+H-H2O"), dbs = list(pedb =
  LipidMS::pedb, lysopedb = LipidMS::lysopedb, mgdb = LipidMS::mgdb,
  adductsTable = LipidMS::adductsTable))
}
\arguments{
\item{MS1}{data frame cointaining all peaks from the full MS function. It
must have three columns: m.z, RT (in seconds) and int (intensity).}

\item{MSMS1}{data frame cointaining all peaks from the low energy function.
It must have three columns: m.z, RT and int.}

\item{MSMS2}{data frame cointaining all peaks from the high energy
function if it is the case. It must have three columns: m.z, RT and int.
Optional.}

\item{ppm_precursor}{mass tolerance for precursor ions. By default, 5 ppm.}

\item{ppm_products}{mass tolerance for product ions. By default, 10 ppm.}

\item{rttol}{total rt window for coelution between precursor and product
ions. By default, 3 seconds.}

\item{rt}{rt range where the function will look for candidates. By default,
it will search within all RT range in MS1.}

\item{adducts}{expected adducts for LPE in ESI+. Adducts allowed can
be modified in adductsTable (dbs argument).}

\item{clfrags}{vector containing the expected fragments for a given lipid
class. See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{clrequired}{logical vector indicating if each class fragment is
required or not. If any of them is required, at least one of them must be
present within the coeluting fragments. See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{ftype}{character vector indicating the type of fragments in clfrags.
It can be: "F" (fragment), "NL" (neutral loss) or "BB" (building block).
See \link{checkClass} for details.}

\item{chainfrags_sn1}{character vector containing the fragmentation rules for
the chain fragments. See \link{chainFrags} for details.}

\item{dbs}{list of data bases required for annotation. By default, dbs
contains the required data frames based on the default fragmentation rules.
If these rules are modified, dbs may need to be changed. If data bases have
been customized using \link{createLipidDB}, they also have to be modified
here.}

\description{
LPE identification based on fragmentation patterns for LC-MS/MS
AIF data acquired in positive mode.
}
\details{
\code{idLPEpos} function involves 3 steps. 1) FullMS-based
identification of candidate LPE as M+H and M+Na. 2) Search of
LPE class fragments: neutral loss of 141.01909 coeluting with the
precursor ion. 3) Search of specific fragments that confirm chain
composition in sn1 (MG as M+H-H2O).

Results data frame shows: ID, class of lipid, CDB (total number
of carbons and double bounds), FA composition (specific chains composition if
it has been confirmed), mz, RT (in seconds), I (intensity, which comes
directly from de input), Adducts, ppm (m.z error), confidenceLevel (in this
case, as LPE only have one chain, only Subclass and FA level are possible).
}
\note{
Isotopes should be removed before identification to avoid false
positives.
This function has been writen based on fragmentation patterns observed for
two different platforms (QTOF 6550 from Agilent and Sinapt G2-Si from Waters),
but it may need to be customized for other platforms or acquisition settings.
